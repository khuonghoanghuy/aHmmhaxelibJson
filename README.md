# a Hmm haxelib Json
This repo contains hmm.json was fixed for some FNF Engine and other

### This repo include:
- Psych Engine 0.6.3

## was this can do?
i made this cuz are too pissed about issues build log haxe lol, so i made a fixed version of `hmm.json` for some fnf engine when you maybe get that issues too!

## How to using them???
`haxelib install hmm && haxelib run hmm install` on a fnf project, remember to put the `hmm.json` file in the folder contains `Project.xml`

for using Psych Engine, you need to using haxe 4.2.5 on all version cuz using the new one give alot of error stuff
